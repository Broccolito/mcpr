MCP-compliant R code execution and management agent for Claude Desktop Extension.

<img src="assets/poster.png" alt="MCPR" width="300" style="display:inline;">

Empower R programming with Model Context Protocol.

## Overview

**mcpr** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows Claude to generate, execute, and manage R scripts within a user-specified directory. It provides a complete workflow for statistical programming and data analysis through natural language interaction — no manual setup required.

## Features

- **Execute R code and scripts** directly from Claude
- **Manage R script files** — create, rename, append, and write
- **Set and manage working directories** for analysis projects
- **Inspect R objects** and session state
- **Read and preview output files** (CSV, TSV, RDS, text, etc.)
- **List and manage exported results**
- **Automatic workspace saving**
- **Sandboxed file operations** for safety

## Installation (No Dependencies Needed)

### Step 1: Download `mcpr.mcpb`

Simply download the latest **`mcpr.mcpb`** file from this repository or release page.

### Step 2: Install in Claude Desktop

1. Locate the downloaded `mcpr.mcpb` file
2. Double-click the file
3. Claude Desktop will open and prompt to install
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

## Configuration (Optional)

To streamline your workflow:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to **Settings → Extensions → MCP Servers**
3. Find **“mcpr”**
4. Enable **“Allow tools to run without permission”** (Auto-approve)
5. Restart Claude Desktop

## Usage Examples

Once installed, you can interact with `mcpr` using natural language.
 Here are common commands and workflows:

### Common Commands

#### Setup & Confiuration

```
"Set working directory to ~/my_analysis"    # Initialize workspace
"Show current state"                        # Check configuration
"Find R executable"                         # Verify R installation
```

#### File Management

```
"Create an R file called analysis.R"        # New script with scaffold
"Write R code to load and plot data"        # Generate and save code
"Append summary statistics to my script"    # Add to existing file
"Rename script.R to final_analysis.R"       # Rename files
"List all R files"                          # View R scripts
```

#### Code Execution

```
"Run my R script"                           # Execute primary file
"Run R expression: mean(1:10)"              # Quick calculations
"Execute analysis.R with arguments"         # Run with parameters
"Show R objects in workspace"               # Inspect saved data
```

#### Data Operations

```
"Preview data.csv"                          # View CSV/TSV data
"Read results.txt"                          # Read text files
"List all output files"                     # See generated files
"Show files created today"                  # Recent outputs
```

#### Visualization & Analysis

```
"Optimize my ggplot code"                   # Improve plot styling
"Check ggplot style in my script"           # Style analysis
"Create publication-ready plot"             # High-quality output
```

## Example Workflows

### Basic Data Analysis

```
You: Create an R script for linear regression analysis
You: Load the mtcars dataset and fit a model of mpg vs weight
You: Run the script and show the model summary
You: Create diagnostic plots for the model
You: Save the plots as high-resolution PNGs
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

```
You: Set working directory to ~/data_project
You: Read my raw_data.csv file and show a preview
You: Create a script to clean missing values and outliers
You: Transform the data and save as cleaned_data.csv
You: Generate summary statistics and visualizations
```

### Publication-Quality Visualization

```
You: Create a ggplot scatter plot with trend line
You: Add confidence intervals and customize colors
You: Optimize the plot code for publication
You: Save as figure1.png with 800 DPI
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```
You: Load the iris dataset
You: Create a script for exploratory analysis
You: Generate summary statistics by species
You: Create box plots and correlation matrices
You: Run everything and show the results
```
